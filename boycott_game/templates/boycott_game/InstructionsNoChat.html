<h2>Welcome to the Monopolist Boycott Game</h2>

<ul>
    <li>You are either a <strong>monopolist</strong> or a <strong>consumer</strong>.</li>
    <li>In each round, the monopolist sets a price.</li>
    <li>Consumers will decide whether to buy at that price.</li>
    <li>Your earnings depend on your role, the price, and the decisions made.</li>
    <li><strong>If you are the monopolist:</strong> your earnings = price × number of consumers who buy.</li>
    <li><strong>If you are a consumer:</strong> if you buy, your earnings = your value − price; if you don’t buy, your earnings = 0.</li>
</ul>
