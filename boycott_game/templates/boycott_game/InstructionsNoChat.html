<h2>Welcome to the Monopolist Boycott Game</h2>

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Today, you are participating in an economic decision‑making study in which a single monopolist sets prices and you as a consumer will decide whether to buy or not. 
    We want to understand how consumers may (or may not) coordinate their choices when facing a seller with market power. <p>

</ul>
    <li>This experiment consists of a <strong>monopolist</strong> with <strong>5 consumers</strong>.</li>
    <li>In each round, the monopolist will set a price and consumers will decide whether to buy at that price.</li>
    <li>In all rounds, your earnings will depend on your role, price, and buying decision.</li>
</ul>
